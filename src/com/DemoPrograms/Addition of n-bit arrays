Input: 
Two n bit binary integers stored in two n element array of binary digits (either 0 or 1) A = <a1,a2,a3..,an> and B = <b1,b2,b3,..,bn>.
Output:
A(n+1) bit binary integer stored in (n+1) element array of binary digits (either 0 or 1) C = <c1,c2,..,cn+1> such that C = A + B.
But here, instead of making a generalized program, I have already provided some input in the program itself. To check whether my code is correct or wrong.
